# In the town of Digitville, there was a list of numbers called nums containing integers from 0 to n - 1. 
# Each number was supposed to appear exactly once in the list, however, two mischievous numbers sneaked in 
# an additional time, making the list longer than usual.

# As the town detective, your task is to find these two sneaky numbers. Return an array of size two containing 
# the two numbers (in any order), so peace can return to Digitville.
